How to run:

Make surer you have the full jcurses folder somewhere:

compile with 

javac -cp "PATH:./" Test.java

where PATH is the path to the jar file in your jcurses folder

i.g

javac -cp "/home/sachal/jcurses/lib/jcurses.jar:./" Test.java



run with

java -cp "PATH:./" Test.java



How to use:

Once you run the program: press the key 'a' and you will see that it closes.

Important notes:

this implementation is relatively gui -ish and breaks when you try to just regular SOP.  We need to somehow make it so its detecting in
a regular terminal window rather than that other jcurses proccess


you can try experimenting but im looking in to how multithreading can fix this
