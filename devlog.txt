1/10/2016 | Shantanu & Sachal | Project Proposal:
    We finished our project proposal and to make it look pretty we used LaTeX to
    format it. We also included a detailed stage roadmap and now we are ready to
    begin and make a great APCS project!

	
1.11.2016 | Sachal | Colors & Shapes
	I added the ascii version of all the shapes with different colors and the construction of the board

1.13.2016 | Shantanu | Hierarchy
    Tetris 
        BlockGame
            EasyGame
            MedGame
            HardGame
        NoBlockGame

1.14.2016 | Shantanu | GridPiece & Tetris Game
    * Created the basic outline for our Tetris Grid
    * Each box on the grid is represented by a GridPiece, which is an object
      that has properties of a color, design, state, and type
        * The color, and design determine what is printed in the grid when we
          print our Tetris game
        * The state determines whether the design is actually printed (in the
          appropriate color) or a blank space is put in its place
    * Right now we are making the basic Tetris game and we can implement it in
      the more specilized versions of the game we are developing
    * We are representing the game grid as a 2D array of GridPieces and each
      Tetris game piece is also represented by a 2D array of GridPieces 

1.15.2016 | Shantanu | GamePiece & States
    * Added a class of GamePiece which will be an object that helps show how
      many game blocks are on the field
    * Added all possible states of a piece to GamePiece
        * Lots of true, false
1.16.2015 | Shantanu | Falling & GamePieces & GameBlocks
    * Figured out a way to store falling blocks versus stationary blocks 
    * Figured out a way to make the falling blocks fall
    * Added boundaries so that the falling blocks know when to stop falling
1.17.2015 | Shantanu | Update Turns 
    * I updated the GamePiece with turn and move methods

=======
1.25-26.2016 | Shantanu | Bash Script && adapting code
    * I implemented new code into Sachal's awesome input code
    * Wrote a bash script to run the game both in 32-bit and 64-bit OS
    * Updated README
    * Updated conditions --- so many conditions ugh
    * fixed minor bugs
    * been working on cloud9 because still can't fink the jcurses lib for it to work
